# Measurement_App_2023
A data measurement app I made in 2023 as an entry for a programming contest. 

The app was meant to fetch data from a server hosted by an industrial cooler and represent it using a graph and a table. The app comes with SQLite database support and has Excel export functionality
Used libraries include MatPlotLib, Pandas, SQLite, Tkinter and basic python libraries - time, requests, threading, etc.
